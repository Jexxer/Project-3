## Introduction

This is a Full MERN Stack bug tracking system web application. It's an in-house application that allows Users to report bugs. It consists of 3 different level of users ranging from level 1 to level 3. Users are able to report a bug through a ticket submission.

- **Level 1** users are your employee users who ONLY have the ability to submit a new ticket and view tickets regarding the bug they reported.
- **Level 2** users will be able to view the tickets submitted and the tickets assigned to them to resolve from the Admin user (Level 3) and able to update the status of the ticket
- **Level 3** users also known as the admin users will have full autonomy and be granted access to add new employees, assign priviledge levels, assign work and monitor the status of bugs.
